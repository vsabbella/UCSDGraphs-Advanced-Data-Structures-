Class: MapGraph

Modifications made to MapGraph (what and why):
    Added variables numEdges and numVertices to track number of edges and vertices.
    Added a map variable mapGraphAdjList to represent the graph using adjacency list.
    Initialized the variables in constructor.
    Implemented getters getNumEdges, getNumVertices and getVertices 
    Implemented the methods addVertices and add Edges
    Implemented bfs
    Added printgraph method
    And Updated the main method to test with data from simplemap.data.

 

Class name: MapNode

Purpose and description of class:
This class reprents the Vertices in a graph along with its neighbouring vertices. 
The neighbouring vertices are tracked using MapEdge datatype.
It also contains location information represented using Geographic point.


Class name: MapEdge

Purpose and description of class:
This class represents the neighbours of vertices and their
resepective informatoin like type of road, name of road and distance.


Overall design:
The graph is represented using adjacency list matrix. As the start and endpoints are represented using Geographic point,
the adjacency list points from GeographicPoint to MapNode. MapNode are retrieved from adjacencyList for traversal from start to goal using MapNode.
We get the list of neighbours from MapNode represented using list of edges.
